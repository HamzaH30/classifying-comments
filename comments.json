A few months later, some Super Mario RPG music got claimed (the song Beware The Forest Mushrooms was mentioned here in Charlie&#39;s vid) and people took that to mean a character from that game would be added to Smash. This theory was mostly popular in a theory circle dedicated to that character, whom a lot of people love and a lot of people hate. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the original takedown of Beware was from some troll trying to mess with that community. (I&#39;m specifically thinking of the PapaGenos community, but I know it extended past his fanbase a bit). They probably just got power trippy and went after Gilva, cuz he&#39;s known as a menace to Nintendo lol",

Furthermore, even doing this, there is zero strong evidence against him.<br><br>The biggest thing some people claim is that Lechmere lied to the police and gave them a false name. Did he? Sure. But interestingly enough, he also gave them his correct address and his place of employment. So it‚Äôs more likely that he was commonly using the name Cross because it makes no sense to give a false name but still tell the police where you live.<br><br>There was one witness who saw Lechmere standing over the body. Robert Paul‚Äôs own testimony was that Nichols body was very cold. It takes 10 to 20 minutes for a body to get cold. The ‚Äúevidence‚Äù against Lechmere claims he was caught in the act or immediately afterward.<br><br>Another piece of evidence is that he was a local Whitechapel resident and most people believed the Ripper was local. Fine and dandy. There were thousands of other local residents and most Ripper suspects fit this description. Also, Nichols body was found on his route to work. Well, duh. He wasn‚Äôt going to find the body on his way to work if it wasn‚Äôt on his route. This is just lazy reasoning.<br><br>Other than Elizabeth Stride, all the victims were on his route to work. And of course Stride was murdered close to the house that Lechmere‚Äôs mother lived. So one night, on the way to visit his mom, he decides to murder someone. I mean, why go over to mom‚Äôs house if you haven‚Äôt strangled a lady before? If Lechmere was such a impulsive murderer as to do this, why did he stop murdering and live for decades longer?<br><br>Edward Stow ‚ÄúThe police at the time were looking for some sort of special individual. But most crimes turn out to be someone quite ordinary. He [Cross] walked past every single murder scene on his way to work. He is the best suspect so far.&quot;<br><br>The above paragraph is one of the more amusing things I have come across in regards to Lechmere. Stow claims that the police were looking for some sort of special individual and that‚Äôs why they didn‚Äôt suspect Lechmere. This makes no sense because the police were NOT looking for some sort of special individual. Nichols was the first canonical ripper murder. Her body was found on August 31. At the time, they were not looking for a special person that fit a profile of a serial killer named Jack the Ripper or a serial killer at all. It would be weeks and more murders before the police began looking for a ‚Äúspecial individual.‚Äù<br><br>Everything about Lechmere is circumstantial. But the biggest piece of evidence, that being the false name, is completely negated by him giving the correct home address and place of work. It is highly unlikely he was the Ripper.",

It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. Charlie, we need bigger YouTubers to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex.

    "message": "Something I want to point out - literally anyone can pretend to be someone/a corporation and claim things on &quot;behalf of&quot; them. For instance, Pewdiepie has mentioned his music gets claimed by someone pretending to be him but the only way to get rid of that is to go to court and that would just be too much hassle. You can easily make thousands of dollars doing this, YouTube doesn&#39;t do shit about it and I don&#39;t <b>think</b> it technically breaks any laws (I&#39;m no lawyer and certainly don&#39;t condone this behaviour) so people run wild with it. There is a short that explains this titled &quot;PSA: If you ever got a copyright claim from a PewDiePie music&quot;. Not going to link it due to spam filters.",
