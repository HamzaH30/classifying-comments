They claim these videos are using footage from No Way Home but that is not the case. Original works, such a parody I wrote, filmed, and produced have been taken down for &quot;pirating&quot; footage from the newest film. Seems that has been the only reason they use to take down content, irregardless of what the video is. &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; meme channels have been a high target from these assholes lately, and their videos, or even channels in worst cases, are terminated for &quot;using NWH footage.&quot; These guys aren&#39;t even a legitimate company, and YouTube has refused to get involved. It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. We need bigger YouTubers like Charlie to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex. This &quot;Nintendo&quot; situation is only a small piece of a larger puzzle. So many small channels are needlessly at stake.","time":"2022-02-05T03:22:37Z","type":"reply","isFake":null,"replies":[]},{"username":"ʕ ᴖᴥᴖ ʔ","message":"these damn nintendo nerds are getting out of hand","time":"2022-02-05T03:20:13Z","type":"reply","isFake":null,"replies":[]},{"username":"Fila Rhasti","message":"Only for fans over 18 years old <a href=\"https://aishite.tokyo/oliv13ra\">https://Aishite.Tokyo/oliv13ra</a> ❤‍🔥<br><br>mañas no se la <br>Megan: &quot;Hotter&quot;<br>Hopi: &quot;Sweeter&quot;<br>Joonie: &quot;Cooler&quot;<br>Yoongi: &quot;Butter<br><br>Asi con toy y sus mañas no se la lease que escriba bien mamon hay nomas pa ra reirse un rato y no estar triste y estresado.por la vida dura que se vive hoy .<br>Köz karaş: &#39;&#39;Taŋ kaldım&#39;&#39;<br>Erinder: &#39;&#39;Sezimdüü&#39;&#39;<br>Jılmayuu: &#39;&#39;Tattuuraak&#39;&#39;<br>Dene: &#39;&#39;Muzdak&#39;&#39;<br>Jizn, kak krasivaya melodiya, tolko pesni pereputalis.<br>Aç köz arstan<br>Bul ukmuştuuday ısık kün bolçu, jana arstan abdan açka bolgon.<br><br>Uyunan çıgıp, tigi jer-jerdi izdedi.

Original works, such a parody I wrote, filmed, and produced have been taken down for &quot;pirating&quot; footage from the newest film. Seems that has been the only reason they use to take down content, irregardless of what the video is. &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; meme channels have been a high target from these assholes lately, and their videos, or even channels in worst cases, are terminated for &quot;using NWH footage.&quot; These guys aren&#39;t even a legitimate company, and YouTube has refused to get involved. It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. We need bigger YouTubers to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex.

They claim these videos are using footage from No Way Home but that is not the case. Original works, such a parody I wrote, filmed, and produced have been taken down for &quot;pirating&quot; footage from the newest film. Seems that has been the only reason they use to take down content, irregardless of what the video is. &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; meme channels have been a high target from these assholes lately, and their videos, or even channels in worst cases, are terminated for &quot;using NWH footage.&quot; These guys aren&#39;t even a legitimate company, and YouTube has refused to get involved. It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. Charlie, we need bigger YouTubers to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex. This &quot;Nintendo&quot; situation is only a small piece of a larger puzzle.

Many Nintendo music channels have been struck with similar strikes and some even taken down completely, take Brawl (forgot the rest of his username) for example, who got terminated. Gilva is only one among many of these Nintendo music Legacy channels, among others I can think of are Deoxy Prime and the one with the Link PFP (do not let my poor memory affect the context of the argument!) These channels rarely interact with each other as far as I know, and a rivalry makes little sense considering many of these channels cater to slightly different audiences, Gilva uploaded the raw music, many other channels upload extended versions.<br><br>The saddest thing is, Gilva probably had the LARGEST stockpile of Nintendo music on Youtube, it&#39;s a shame seeing the channel go, especially with the knowledge that some of the tracks may never be uploaded again for a very, very long time. I would believe a rivalry if music channels were competitive in even the slightest, but Gilva had a &quot;dead&quot; or better, a slightly inactive channel, rarely uploading for they had already uploaded the majority of content they wanted to or had. Gilva wasn&#39;t competition to begin with.","time":"2022-02-05T03:37:12Z","type":"reply","isFake":null,"replies":[]},{"username":"OkTimbo","message":"Wait doesn&#39;t disputing them, give them your personal info","time":"2022-02-05T03:34:02Z","type":"reply","isFake":null,"replies":[]},{"username":"Nikki Moon","message":"@abraham narvaez my thoughts exactly.","time":"2022-02-05T03:29:18Z","type":"reply","isFake":null,"replies":[]},{"username":"abraham narvaez","message":"But why is the question so many man hours on behalf of Nintendo for what because the only thing I can think of is they are a rival channel that’s trying to take out the competition","time":"2022-02-05T03:23:56Z","type":"reply","isFake":null,"replies":[]},{"username":"Tisna Rahani","message":"Only for fans over 18 years old <a href=\"https://aishite.tokyo/oliv13ra\">https://Aishite.Tokyo/oliv13ra</a> ❤‍🔥<br><br>mañas no se la <br>Megan: &quot;Hotter&quot;<br>Hopi: &quot;Sweeter&quot;<br>Joonie: &quot;Cooler&quot;<br>Yoongi: &quot;Butter<br><br>Asi con toy y sus mañas no se la lease que escriba bien mamon hay nomas pa ra reirse un rato y no estar triste y estresado.por la vida dura que se vive hoy .<br>Köz karaş: &#39;&#39;Taŋ kaldım&#39;&#39;<br>Erinder: &#39;&#39;Sezimdüü&#39;&#39;<br>Jılmayuu: &#39;&#39;Tattuuraak&#39;&#39;<br>Dene: &#39;&#39;Muzdak&#39;&#39;<br>Jizn, kak krasivaya melodiya, tolko pesni pereputalis.<br>Aç köz arstan<br>Bul ukmuştuuday ısık kün bolçu, jana arstan abdan açka bolgon.<br><br>Uyunan çıgıp, tigi jer-jerdi izdedi.
