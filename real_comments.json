Few years ago during the Smash DLC character announcements people realized that just before Banjo was announced, some Banjo &amp; Kazooie music got copyright claimed by the actual Nintendo, if memory serves. A few months later, some Super Mario RPG music got claimed (the song Beware The Forest Mushrooms was mentioned here in Charlie&#39;s vid) and people took that to mean a character from that game would be added to Smash. This theory was mostly popular in a theory circle dedicated to that character, whom a lot of people love and a lot of people hate. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the original takedown of Beware was from some troll trying to mess with that community. (I&#39;m specifically thinking of the PapaGenos community, but I know it extended past his fanbase a bit). They probably just got power trippy and went after Gilva, cuz he&#39;s known as a menace to Nintendo lol"

    "comment": "The biggest problem with the Lechmere theory is that the \u201cresearch\u201d began with the assumption that Lechmere was the Ripper and then the research went backwards to try and fit Lechmere into the murders. Furthermore, even doing this, there is zero strong evidence against him.<br><br>The biggest thing some people claim is that Lechmere lied to the police and gave them a false name. Did he? Sure. But interestingly enough, he also gave them his correct address and his place of employment. So it\u2019s more likely that he was commonly using the name Cross because it makes no sense to give a false name but still tell the police where you live.<br><br>There was one witness who saw Lechmere standing over the body. Robert Paul\u2019s own testimony was that Nichols body was very cold. It takes 10 to 20 minutes for a body to get cold. The \u201cevidence\u201d against Lechmere claims he was caught in the act or immediately afterward.<br><br>Another piece of evidence is that he was a local Whitechapel resident and most people believed the Ripper was local. Fine and dandy. There were thousands of other local residents and most Ripper suspects fit this description. Also, Nichols body was found on his route to work. Well, duh. He wasn\u2019t going to find the body on his way to work if it wasn\u2019t on his route. This is just lazy reasoning.<br><br>Other than Elizabeth Stride, all the victims were on his route to work. And of course Stride was murdered close to the house that Lechmere\u2019s mother lived. So one night, on the way to visit his mom, he decides to murder someone. I mean, why go over to mom\u2019s house if you haven\u2019t strangled a lady before? If Lechmere was such a impulsive murderer as to do this, why did he stop murdering and live for decades longer?<br><br>Edward Stow \u201cThe police at the time were looking for some sort of special individual. But most crimes turn out to be someone quite ordinary. He [Cross] walked past every single murder scene on his way to work. He is the best suspect so far.&quot;<br><br>The above paragraph is one of the more amusing things I have come across in regards to Lechmere. Stow claims that the police were looking for some sort of special individual and that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t suspect Lechmere. This makes no sense because the police were NOT looking for some sort of special individual. Nichols was the first canonical ripper murder. Her body was found on August 31. At the time, they were not looking for a special person that fit a profile of a serial killer named Jack the Ripper or a serial killer at all. It would be weeks and more murders before the police began looking for a \u201cspecial individual.\u201d<br><br>Everything about Lechmere is circumstantial. But the biggest piece of evidence, that being the false name, is completely negated by him giving the correct home address and place of work. It is highly unlikely he was the Ripper."

They claim these videos are using footage from No Way Home but that is not the case. Original works, such a parody I wrote, filmed, and produced have been taken down for &quot;pirating&quot; footage from the newest film. Seems that has been the only reason they use to take down content, irregardless of what the video is. &quot;Bully Maguire&quot; meme channels have been a high target from these assholes lately, and their videos, or even channels in worst cases, are terminated for &quot;using NWH footage.&quot; These guys aren&#39;t even a legitimate company, and YouTube has refused to get involved. It&#39;s one thing to have this kind of content taken down by copyright owners (such as Sony, Disney, or Insomniac because even GAMEPLAY footage has been taken down), but Aiplex owns NOTHING. They aren&#39;t a real company with any real legal standing to do this to anyone. I made a video detailing the entire situation in-depth, which Aiplex even tried to take down, even though it&#39;s just me talking into a camera with no background music. Charlie, we need bigger YouTubers to speak out about this. YouTube refuses to get involved, even when faced with a petition that bears 25,000 signatures to look into Aiplex. This &quot;Nintendo&quot; situation is only a small piece of a larger puzzle. So many small channels are needlessly at stake."

As far as I understand, this was the only real source of Nintendo music, that is now completelly gone, so there is a power vacuum, so to speak. Watch out in the next couple days who takes advantage of this gap, create a new youtube channel with few tousands of videos with ads, and begins collecting the sweet sweet youtube revenue, being the new only channel with it&#39;s content.<br>Even less realistic conspiracy, this would be an insane gigabrain move (or potentially just insane move, depending on the outcome) if GilvaSunner staged this all up, just to create drama and draw attention to Nintendo music as he deletes his channel while achieving a world record, only to recreate his own channel under new fake indentity, and gain all the view again, utilizing popularity of this drama to perhaps surpass the size of the no-deleted old channel."

(instantly meaning 24 hours or less. which, i would say for the scale of this situation, is pretty damn instant.) the person, or group, could&#39;ve hired someone, or they have their own guy, who can build an algorithm to delete this guy&#39;s videos. i would call this a trial run of sorts. but that&#39;s just a hypothesis.
